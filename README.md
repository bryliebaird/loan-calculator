# Loan_Calculator

This project is a simple, one page Loan Calculator application which uses vanilla JavaScript and takes user input (loan amount, interest, and years to repay) and returns monthly payment, total payment, and total interest. Bootstrap is used to style the page. 

I completed this project to learn more about DOM methods and manipulating the DOM using plain JavaScript.

This project comes from Udemy - Modern JavaScript From the Beginning, created by Brad Traversy. When working on Udemy projects I like to look at the finished project first and attempt to do most of the project on my own before watching the videos. Provided the link below to his Udemy Course.
